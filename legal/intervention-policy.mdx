# Duskview City Nights Intervention Policy:
## Preface:
When a bar has pushed the line far enough that something becomes so publicly well known, we will make a statement about the issue(s) at hand, and take any and all actions that we can do to process and handle the situation.

(Note: The word/phrase "Groups" includes any VRChat group, and/or it's userbase.  Any single user contributes to the group as a whole.)
What do we take action against:
- Groups that have connections to "gangs" in VRChat.
- Groups that are known to use crasher avatars.
- Any bar group that uses the threat of doxxing.
- Bar groups that use hate speech or imagery, such as Nazi Propaganda

## What can DCN do?
The following interactions can be performed if action is taken against a bar or other organization inside of Duskview/The Sunset Bar

- If your bar/organization is a part of the Discord server, we will mute/soft-lock/ban based on offense(s) made.
- If you're DAB Certified, you may lose the certification wholesale, or be prevented from getting the certification ever.
- For those who are connected to DCN via patronage or support, that patronage can be canceled and services/data removed as soon as the infringement is recorded or reported.

## What can DCN NOT do?
- Remove people permanently from our world(s).  We do not have this power, nor jurisdiction.
- Prevent entire groups from joining our using our world(s).
