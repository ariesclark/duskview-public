# Duskview City Nights Intervention Policy:
## Preface:
The groups that make up VRChat's userbase are a core component of it's livelihood in today's environment.  However, while most groups exist for neutral or good reasons, some groups will push the line or break the rules outright despite their better interests.

If a group commits to breaking the rules of VRChat or of DCN in such a way that cannot be ignored, we will make a public statement about the bar, and remove access to or eliminate features for that group going forward.

(Note: The word/phrase "Group(s)" includes any VRChat group, and/or it's userbase.  Any single user contributes to the group as a whole.)
What do we take action against:
- Groups that have connections to "gangs" in VRChat.
- Groups that are known to use crasher avatars.
- Any bar group that uses the threat of doxxing.
- Bar groups that use hate speech or imagery, such as Nazi Propaganda

## What can DCN do?
The following interactions can be performed if action is taken against a bar or other organization inside of Duskview/The Sunset Bar

- If your bar/organization is a part of the Discord server, we will mute/soft-lock/ban based on offense(s) made.
- If you're DAB Certified, you may lose the certification wholesale, or be prevented from getting the certification ever.
- For those who are connected to DCN via patronage or support, that patronage can be canceled and services/data removed as soon as the infringement is recorded or reported.

## What can DCN NOT do?
- Remove people permanently from our world(s).  We do not have this power, nor jurisdiction.
- Prevent entire groups from joining our using our world(s).

Appeals can be made for offenses that are considered to not be extreme.  Anything involving real world issues and violence are considered to be extreme.

Your data can be lost entirely if your group is considered to be against the community of DCN.  Please be aware that we will not be able to reinstate anything lost due to issues caused by you or your group!
