# Duskview City Nights Bar Author Rules
Following the creation of a "bar" using this website, you must take note of the following policies and rules, lest your bar may be deleted, or you may have specific pieces rejected, such as art and banner work.

## Bar Naming Guidelines
Creation of a bar starts with the name of the bar.  Please make sure that your organization is original enough that it can be distinguished from others.
- Bar names can contain any wording, provided that it is not racist, sexist, homophobic, or demeaning in any way to any person(s).
- Copycat bars will be renamed without warning.  Make sure that your bar's name is original, and not the name of another bar.  Intentional copycat organizations may be refunded or rejected entirely from operating within the space.
- Bar names can be suggestive, but not outright NSFW.  We consider anything describing the process of intercourse, or words/phrases describing genitalia to be NSFW.

## Bar Imagery Guidelines
Once you've started your bar, you are welcome to begin the process of filling banner slots with your own creative artwork.  Please observe the following when publishing art:
- Images must be clean.  Nothing NSFW is allowed on the images, as these images will be filing spaces inside of VRChat, and are subject to their image policies.
- Images must be free of any sort of derogatory wording, phrases, markings, etc.
- Anything published must be your own.  We cannot allow artwork that is another professional organization's work.
- Make sure that your work is free of any real life official branding.  We do not accept this sort of work.
 - If you are legitimately sponsored by a corporation outside of VRChat, we ask that you share proof of this before submitting the art.  Please use the Duskview City Nights Discord (https://discord.gg/duskview) and submit a Patreon Support Ticket to verify this information with us.
- If you are using someone's work, and they request you remove it from your bar's imagery, we ask that you please respect the artist's choice on the matter.  We will take down art that we can verify was made by an artist and respect their wishes.
 - Artists: We recommend that you brand your work in a way that is non-destructive but also in a way that we can see that it is YOUR WORK.  This will help us when making a call in these matters.

## Bar Playlist Guidelines
Please understand that how VRChat works, the playlist system is only capable of taking YouTube links for music.
- Make sure you're grabbing the actual URL for the songs that you're posting.  The "Share" link often times will provide a link that is slightly shortened but does not work with embedding video in other environments.
- You can use playlists!  Each playlist can be up to 50 songs, and will fetch every song link that is not copyright protected on YouTube.  Music that does not post is copyright protected.  UMG is the largest culprit of this.
 - Use a "lyric" video, or an "AMV" version of songs.  These videos will work virtually every time, unless the lyric version was an official release under the label.
- There is no restriction to what videos you put inside of your playlist, but please understand the environment.  Your choices may affect or offend other users around you.

## Bar Roster Guidelines
Filling your roster with people is one of the most exciting parts of your bar!  We know.  There's only a few notes to share about this.
- This note is for you, the owner: Make sure you are electing people in good faith, and know when someone is trying to dismantle your image or organization.  Do not promote people that you don't know, to best protect your interests!
- We do not allow users who suggest that they are part of "VRChat gangs" to be a part of our organization, and will remove them immediately.  We recommend that you do the same.
 - For any bar, Patreon supporter or not, we have a harsh and firm anti-gang policy in effect.  We do not allow them to exist in our space, and remove them when and where possible.  This does not include a "gang" that exists for the sake of Roleplay.

## General Bar Conduct
When you operate in The Sunset Bar, or on the Duskview City Nights Discord, you are subject to the rules of both locations, with our rules presiding over the Discord server, and VRChat's Terms of Service presiding over VRChat based interactions.

If we see you in our own experiences, or through the evidence submitted by other users breaking rules, either our own or VRChat's, you will be reprimanded; starting with a warning for minor offenses, and with direct action taken against more serious ones.

- We do not inherently allow interactions different from VRChat's ToS policies.  (See: https://hello.vrchat.com/legal)
- Under no circumstance do we allow or accept client modders to operate in our spaces.  These users are typically doing this to harm the experience of other users.
- We do not allow racism, sexism, homophobia, or other derogatory speech/imagery/remarks and will remove bars that we catch doing these things.
- At the end of the day, we are the one's who dictate the seriousness of an offense, and are able to process a removal from our service at any time should you be caught infringing on these rules and guidelines.  The service is not to be used except in a way that does not hurt or infringe on the rights of other people.
